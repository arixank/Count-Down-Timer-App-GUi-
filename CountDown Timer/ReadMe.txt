This is made as a part of Code Battle !!

Programming Tool : Python

Technology used : PyQt5 & QtDesigner

Library : time

Main file to run : Count Down Timer.py

Requirements : Python , PyQt5 

Since I have used time which is an inbuilt library from python , it was easy to build the structure and later I used this structure to
implement in a GUI app !!

The gui app was made using qt designer and then generated the code as .py from .ui
later created separate functions for each button and also input for the app !!!
This was later plagued in to the main function !!

Thank You !!!
